## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- React + Vite for the frontend
- Chrome Extensions Manifest V3
- OpenAI API for AI capabilities
- Local storage for settings and chat history

## Project Structure
### Key Components

1. **Background Service Worker** (`background.js`)
   - Handles API communications
   - Manages extension state
   - Processes messages between components

2. **Content Script** (`content.js`)
   - Injects the AI assistant interface
   - Handles DOM interactions
   - Communicates with the background service

3. **Options Page** (`Options.jsx`)
   - API key configuration
   - User preferences
   - Extension settings

4. **Main Interface** (`App.jsx`)
   - Chat interface
   - Product analysis
   - User interactions

## Design Decisions

### 1. Chrome Extension Architecture
- Chose Manifest V3 for future compatibility
- Used content scripts for seamless Amazon integration
- Implemented service worker for background processing

### 2. User Interface
- Floating overlay for easy access
- Chat-based interface for natural interaction
- Minimalist design to avoid cluttering shopping experience

### 3. Security
- Local API key storage
- Secure message passing
- Content security policies
- Host permissions limited to Amazon domains

### 4. Performance
- Lazy loading of components
- Efficient state management
- Optimized API calls
- Local storage for chat history

## Development
